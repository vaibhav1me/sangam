Remove ContextAPI from everywhere for socketIO function
SetUp google auth, github auth
add remember me option
Add httpcodes in backend
specify while signing up that if the username exists or email exists
handle uppercase and lowercase in email and userName
redirect to verifyEmail on signing up
make dark mode
As of now a user can visit a random token in address, and can reset password for some other user whom he may or may not know, fix it such that user can set password only for his email.... Similar problem for verifyEmail also
